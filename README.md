# The math game

The goal of Math Game is to provide both children and adults with a cool way to refresh and maintain their math knowledge, through a clear and robust application. This game will display 10 times 2 random numbers with a random operator that the user must solve as quickly as possible. The game consists of 3 difficulty levels (easy, medium and hard) to challenge yourself.  

* Level easy  

This level is meant for children who are learning math and want to practice it. For this they are given as much time as they need to solve the math equations with smaller numbers. Therefore, there is no scoreboard provided for this grade as each player plays at their own pace.  

* Level medium  

This level is meant for young adults because here you do not play at your own pace. In fact, you are given 5 seconds to solve a math problem otherwise you are not given a point and the next math problem is displayed. The time it took the user to solve the arithmetic is also tracked. This so that both the score and time is passed along to the (sqlite3) database that will provide the scoreboard. This will also be constantly ranked with the players who have the highest score and fastest time at the top.  

* Level hard  

This level is meant for young adults, it is the same principle as level medium but with much larger numbers.

## Features

* Object oriented programming in C++ and C#  
* Database for scoreboard in sqlite3 with C++  
* Generate DLL of database to execute fast method (C++) inside C# program  
* Fully responsive and robust WPF application  
* Added sounds and texts by correct or wrong answers  
* Timer with blinking effect for level medium and hard  
* Doxygen documenting  
* Unit tests
